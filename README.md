# Smart Home Unit
This Smart Home Control Unit was built using an Arduino Mega.

The following were the main objectives of this project:
  - To design a smart home control unit to make a house safe and secure using Smart Door Locking System

  - To create a system that turns on and off the lights automatically according to every users preference

  - To ensure the security in the home by automatically activating the alarm system if any intruder breaks into home

  - To ensure a constant temperature in the house according to every users preference by using a Smart Thermostat System.

Includes the following sensors:
  - Motion sensor
  - Temperature and Humidity sensor
  - Infrared sensors
  - RFID module with the key fobs

The above sensors worked together to make a smarter home and produced outputs to the following:
  - LCD Screen
  - Fan
  - (Addition for the future: Send Alerts to the user on the Phone/Email)

Below are the pictures of the first prototype which was made using cardboard:
